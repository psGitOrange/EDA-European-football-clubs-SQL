Here, Real Madrid created 22 chances more then opposition and more than in any match, with 14 shots on target causing significant offensive pressure, but Barcelona’s defense and goalkeeping turned the tide, securing an unexpected away victory.\n\n**Game 3164 (2016)**: This game ended in a **1-1 draw** with Barcelona at home. It was notable for its **high foul** count, with both teams combining for 19 fouls. This intense physicality, likely part of each team’s defensive strategy, underscored the **fierce competition** typical of El Clásico.\n\n**Games with Dominant Away Team Odds:**\n\n**Game 1510 (2015)**: Barcelona’s away win with a **81% win probability** confirms the strength of their squad that season, clinching a commanding **4-0** victory over Real Madrid.\n\n**Game 8046 (2017)**: Barcelona again defeated Real Madrid with a high **86% away win probability**, and the game ended **3-0** in their favor. \n\n**Game 15074 (2021)**: In this match, Real Madrid as the away team took a **3-1 victory** over Barcelona with a **75% win probability** before match.

The dataset was connected using `sql.connect()` and populated with tables like players, leagues, and teams using `to_sql()`. Through this structured analysis, several insights emerged:\n\n- **Home Advantage**: Home teams consistently achieved higher win rates than away teams, suggesting significant support impact.\n- **Scoring Trends**: To secure a win, both home and away teams averaged around **2.4 goals**, while maintaining strong defense, limiting opponents to an average of **0.55 goals**. Draws saw each team scoring around 1 goal.\n- **League Comparisons**: **Bundesliga** averaged the **highest** scoring rate at **2.95 goals per game**, while **Ligue 1** had the lowest at **2.6 goals**.\n- **Top Performers**: From **2014 to 2020**, **Lionel Messi** led with **231 goals** and ranked first in assists **97**, **sharing** this position with **Kevin De Bruyne**.\n- **League Champions**: In **2018**, top teams across leagues included `Bayern Munich (Bundesliga), Barcelona (La Liga), PSG (Ligue 1), Manchester City (Premier League), and Juventus (Serie A)`.\n- **El Clásico Highlights**: Between **2014 and 2020**, **Barcelona** won **6** times in **El Clásico**, edging out **Real Madrid’s 5** wins. Notable matches included surprising upsets, like **Barcelona’s 3-2 away victory** with a **22% win probability** in 2017, and **Real Madrid’s 2-0 home win** in 2020 with only a **24% win probability**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Conclusion:\n\nThis SQL project explored key aspects of the dataset through `window functions, ranking techniques, SQL functions, views, and indexing`.

The analysis also highlighted team dominance in various leagues and historic El Clásico outcomes, offering valuable insights into performance dynamics, scoring, and match outcomes across seasons.
